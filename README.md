<p>Just clone it to you're computer and use it to initialize your projects.
<br/>The directory structure is based on this topic:</p>

* <p>When looking for Plugins, you should look in here:</p>
  http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/
<p>But you can also use other plugins from standard cordova or anything else.</p>

<br/>

* <p>There are places in the index.html to load your javascript files on the
bottom of the file, please use it as a guide.</p>

<br/>

* <p>Any time that you'll use an cordova plugin, put it in a 
document.addEventListener "deviceready" function to make sure that it will
work properly.</p>
